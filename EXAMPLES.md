## üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the better Claude can help
2. **Use Context**: Refer to "current file", "this function", "active editor"
3. **Chain Commands**: Ask for multiple related operations in sequence
4. **Ask for Explanations**: Don't just ask for changes, ask Claude to explain what it's doing
5. **Review Changes**: Always review the changes Claude makes before saving

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Try combining multiple commands in a single request
